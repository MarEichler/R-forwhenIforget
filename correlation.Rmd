## base R correlation: `cor()`  


```{r}
cor(mtcars[,1:4])
```

If data has NA's in any of the values the `cor()` will results in `NA`.  If you want to remove the NA's when calculating correlation do: 

```
cor(..., use = "complete.obs")
```

## Dot Plots for Multiple Variables: `pairs()`  
 
That chart that plots all variables against eachother as a dot plot when looking to see if variables are correlated with eachother 



```{r}
#lots of variables so only look at first 4
testdf <- mtcars[,1:4]
pairs(testdf, main = "title")
```
